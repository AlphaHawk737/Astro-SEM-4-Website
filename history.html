            <p>From the previous article, we already understood what dark matter is and how it differs from baryonic matter. 
                Now, let us move ahead and explore the history of dark matter detection.
            </p>

            <p>
                The story begins in 1933 with Fritz Zwicky, who was working at Caltech using an 18-inch telescope at Mount Palomar.
                 While studying the Coma Cluster, Zwicky observed that the angular velocities of the galaxies were far higher than 
                 the values predicted from the amount of visible matter present.
            </p>

            <p>
             According to the laws of gravity, the observed visible matter was insufficient to produce enough gravitational pull 
             to hold the cluster together. Based on calculation, the galaxies should either have been moving much slower or flown 
             apart entirely.
            </p>

            <p>
                To explain this discrepancy, Zwicky proposed the existence of an unseen form of matter responsible for the additional 
                gravitational effect. He called this invisible component dark matter.
            </p>

         
            <p>
             Cut to 1970s, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford, working at the Carnegie Institution of Science, studied the Andromeda galaxy. 
             They observed that stars at the outer edge of the galaxy were moving just as fast as those near the center.
            </p>

            <p>
                This unexpected result indicated the presence of an invisible dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy, providing additional gravitational pull. Their findings indirectly confirmed and strengthened the 
                earlier observations made by Fritz Zwicky.
            </p>



            <p>
               Further evidence from galaxy clusters and cosmological studies led to universal acceptance of dark matter by the late 1970s and 1980s.
