            <h2>Dark Matter: The Invisible Physicality of the Universe</h2>

            <h3>What Is Matter?</h3>

            <p>
                Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and possesses mass — a fundamental
                physical property of all material existence. The universe we observe operates through
                measurable interactions governed by fundamental forces.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ordinary (baryonic) matter interacts through four fundamental forces:
                gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear. These interactions
                allow it to emit light, absorb radiation, form atoms, and construct the visible
                structure of the cosmos.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dark matter, in contrast, possesses mass and interacts gravitationally, yet does
                not interact with the electromagnetic force. It neither emits nor absorbs light,
                leaving no direct optical signature.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of this absence of electromagnetic interaction, it remains invisible —
                hence the term <em>dark</em> matter. It is important to clarify that dark matter
                is not antimatter; it represents a distinct and still unidentified component
                of the universe.
            </p>

            <p>
                While baryonic matter is well described by the Standard Model of particle physics,
                the composition of dark matter remains one of the most significant unsolved
                problems in astrophysics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Current cosmological measurements indicate that approximately 5% of the universe
                consists of baryonic matter, whereas roughly 27% is composed of dark matter.
                The electromagnetic window is closed to it — yet the gravitational window remains open.
            </p>

            <section class="content-section">

            <h2>How We Realized It Exists</h2>

            <p>
                Dark matter was not predicted theoretically in advance. Its existence was inferred
                from observational discrepancies between visible mass and gravitational behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the late 19th century, Lord Kelvin noted inconsistencies in stellar motions within
                the Milky Way, suggesting unseen mass. Later, Henri Poincaré formalized the concept
                under the term “dark matter.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky studied the Coma Cluster and discovered that visible matter
                accounted for only a fraction of the gravitational mass required to keep the cluster bound.
                This implied a large component of unseen matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Definitive evidence emerged in the 1970s when Vera Rubin and Kent Ford measured
                galaxy rotation curves. Instead of decreasing with distance from the galactic center,
                stellar velocities remained nearly constant — implying an extended halo of invisible mass.
            </p>

            <p>
                Subsequent confirmation arrived through gravitational lensing, X-ray cluster analysis,
                and measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Cosmological models accurately
                reproduce observed temperature fluctuations only when dark matter is included.
            </p>

            </section>


            <section class="content-section">

            <h2>Evidence and Galactic Dynamics</h2>

            <p>
                If visible stars contained all galactic mass, orbital velocity would decline with
                increasing radius. Observations show otherwise — velocity curves flatten at large
                distances from the galactic center.
            </p>

            <p>
                This indicates that additional mass extends far beyond the luminous region of galaxies.
                The result is the dark matter halo model.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gravitational lensing provides independent verification. According to general relativity,
                light bends around massive objects. Observed lensing often exceeds what visible mass
                alone can explain.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Cosmic Microwave Background further supports this conclusion. Its anisotropy spectrum
                aligns precisely with theoretical models only when dark matter is included as a
                cosmological component.

            <h2>Why Detecting Dark Matter Is Difficult</h2>

            <p>
                Dark matter constitutes approximately 85% of all matter in the universe.
                Without it, galaxies would not remain gravitationally stable.
            </p>

            <p>
                The difficulty arises from its lack of electromagnetic interaction.
                It cannot be directly observed, imaged, or isolated using conventional
                detection techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                The universe is filled with background noise: cosmic rays, radiation,
                and high-energy particles constantly interact with Earth. Any dark matter
                interaction would be extraordinarily subtle.
            </p>

            <p>
                To reduce interference, experiments are conducted deep underground,
                where layers of rock shield detectors from cosmic radiation.
            </p>

            </section>


            <section class="content-section">

            <h2>Direct Detection: Waiting for a Signal</h2>

            <p>
                Some experiments utilize large volumes of liquid xenon to detect rare
                nuclear recoils caused by potential dark matter collisions.
            </p>

            <p>
                A successful interaction would produce a minute flash of light and a
                measurable electron signal. These events are extremely rare and
                require ultra-sensitive instrumentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although no definitive detection has been confirmed, experimental
                sensitivity continues to improve, narrowing the range of viable
                dark matter properties.

            <h2>Axions and Other Candidates</h2>

            <p>
                Axions represent a class of extremely light hypothetical particles.
                Instead of colliding with atoms, they may convert into faint
                electromagnetic signals under strong magnetic fields.
            </p>

            <p>
                Microwave cavity experiments attempt to detect these subtle
                frequency shifts with advanced quantum amplification techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other indirect searches examine gamma rays or high-energy particles
                that may result from dark matter annihilation or decay.
            </p>

                <li><strong>WIMPs</strong> — Weakly Interacting Massive Particles.</li>
                <li><strong>Axions</strong> — Ultra-light, low-energy particle candidates.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The central question remains unresolved: does dark matter fit within
                an extension of the Standard Model, or does it require an entirely new
                theoretical framework?
