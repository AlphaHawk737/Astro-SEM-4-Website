    <h2 class="reveal">Dark Matter: The Invisible Physicality of the Universe</h2>

    <h3 class="reveal">What Is Matter?</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      A basic understanding defines matter as anything that occupies space and has mass—a fundamental
      property of any object. Space is the geometric environment we experience.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Normal matter interacts with its surroundings through the fundamental forces: gravitational
      (a ball in free fall), electromagnetic (a magnetic crane lifting a car), strong nuclear force
      (binding quarks), and weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactive decay). Essentially,
      anything made of normal matter interacts with its environment, and its behavior and presence
      can be understood through the mathematical study of mechanics.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Then what is this different entity called dark matter? From a physics perspective, dark matter
      is a form of matter that possesses mass, interacts gravitationally, and exerts gravitational
      influence on its surroundings. However, it does not interact with the electromagnetic force,
      leaving no possibility for light emission, absorption, reflection, or any other electromagnetic
      phenomenon.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Because of this, it remains invisible—hence the name “dark” matter—yet it represents a
      fundamental physical component of the cosmos. One thing must be made clear: dark matter is not
      antimatter.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p class="reveal">
      The composition of baryonic matter can be explained and understood by the Standard Model of
      particle physics. In contrast, the composition of dark matter remains one of the greatest
      astrophysical mysteries and cannot currently be explained by the Standard Model.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Approximately 5% of the universe consists of baryonic matter, while about 27% is composed of
      dark matter. The primary challenge with dark matter is its inability to interact with the
      electromagnetic force, making detection through traditional telescope methods impossible.
      Fortunately, while the electromagnetic window is closed, the gravitational window remains open.
    </p>

    <h3 class="reveal">How We Realized It Exists</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      This exotic form of matter, which does not interact electromagnetically and is invisible to our
      eyes, makes up roughly 27% of the universe. How did we even know to search for something like
      this? Was it predicted theoretically, like the Higgs boson? Surprisingly, no.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      The idea of invisible matter was first proposed in the 1880s by Lord Kelvin, who noticed that
      the observed kinetic energy of stars in the Milky Way did not match the galaxy’s gravitational
      energy. This discrepancy suggested the presence of more matter than what was visible. He
      referred to this missing component as “dark stars.” Later, in 1906, Henri Poincaré formalized
      this concept under the term dark matter.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      For several decades, the idea saw little progress. That changed when Fritz Zwicky studied the
      Coma Cluster and found that it contained far more mass than could be accounted for by visible
      matter alone—nearly hundreds of times more in his initial estimates. Although later revisions
      reduced this value, the concept of unseen mass gained traction within the astrophysical
      community.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      One of the most compelling pieces of evidence emerged in the 1970s, when Vera Rubin and Kent
      Ford analyzed the rotation curve of the Andromeda galaxy. A rotation curve plots the orbital
      velocity of stars against their distance from the galactic center. Their observations showed
      that stellar velocities remained unexpectedly high far from the visible disk, implying the
      presence of five to ten times more matter than what could be seen. This led to the dark matter
      halo model for spiral galaxies.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Subsequent observations—including gravitational lensing, studies of quasars, X-ray observations
      of the Bullet Cluster, and measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background—strengthened the
      case. The tiny temperature fluctuations in the CMB are accurately reproduced only by
      cosmological models that include both baryonic and dark matter.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      All available evidence strongly supports the existence of dark matter. The challenge now lies
      in identifying its nature and learning how to detect it directly.
    </p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Evidence and Galaxy Rotation</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      Detection of dark matter is closely tied to the same evidence that revealed it. One of the most
      important indicators is the galaxy rotation curve. If mass were concentrated only where
      visible stars exist, the orbital velocity of stars should decrease with increasing distance
      from the galactic center. However, observations show that this velocity remains nearly constant
      far beyond the visible disk.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      This discrepancy implies the presence of additional, unseen matter extending well beyond the
      galaxy’s luminous region.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Gravitational lensing provides further evidence. According to general relativity, light bends
      around massive objects. In many regions of the universe, lensing effects are observed where
      little or no visible matter exists, indicating hidden mass.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      The Cosmic Microwave Background also carries the imprint of dark matter. Its temperature
      fluctuations align with theoretical models only when dark matter is included as a fundamental
      component of the universe.
    </p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Why Detecting Dark Matter Is Hard</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      Dark matter is real. It accounts for roughly 85% of all matter in the universe, and without it,
      galaxies would not remain gravitationally bound. That much is established.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      The difficulty lies in the fact that dark matter cannot be seen, touched, or directly observed.
      It is like trying to prove the existence of something that refuses to leave any obvious trace.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      To overcome this, physicists turned to innovative solutions. The universe is filled with
      noise—cosmic rays, radiation, and energetic particles constantly bombard Earth. Any dark matter
      interaction would be extremely subtle, making surface-level detection nearly impossible.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      The solution was both simple and extreme: conduct experiments deep underground. Facilities
      buried beneath kilometers of rock use the Earth itself as a shield against cosmic interference.
    </p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Direct Detection: Waiting for a Hit</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      Some experiments employ massive tanks filled with liquid xenon and wait for rare interactions.
      The idea is that a dark matter particle might occasionally collide with a xenon nucleus. Such a
      collision would cause the nucleus to recoil, releasing electrons and producing a tiny flash of
      light that sensitive detectors can observe.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      So far, no definitive detection has been made. However, these experiments have become
      extraordinarily sensitive, ruling out large regions of possible dark matter properties.
      Although detection remains elusive, the range of hiding places for dark matter is steadily
      shrinking.
    </p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Axions: Listening Instead of Watching</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      Axions represent a different class of dark matter candidates. They are extremely light and
      behave unlike the massive particles originally proposed. Instead of colliding with atoms,
      axions are expected to convert into faint electromagnetic signals under specific conditions.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      To detect them, scientists use powerful magnetic fields and microwave cavities, effectively
      tuning into frequencies never before explored. Advances in quantum amplification have
      drastically reduced the time required to scan these signals.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Another approach involves searching for secondary signals. If dark matter particles annihilate
      or decay, they may produce gamma rays or other high-energy particles. Observations of regions
      such as the galactic center have produced intriguing results, though none have yet reached
      confirmed status.
    </p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Ongoing Work in Dark Matter Research</h3>

    <p class="reveal">
      Dark matter does not interact with the electromagnetic force; its influence is purely
      gravitational. Baryonic matter, on the other hand, is well described by the Standard Model,
      which serves as a comprehensive guide to its behavior and interactions.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      In this sense, the Standard Model acts as a “recipe book” for normal matter. The ongoing
      challenge in dark matter research is to uncover its own recipe book—the particle or particles
      that constitute it.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Several candidates have been proposed:
    </p>

    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>
        <strong>WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)</strong> — Hypothetical particles that are
        heavy, slow-moving, and weakly interacting. Their annihilation could produce gamma rays.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Axions</strong> — Hypothetical particles that are extremely light and low in energy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="reveal">
      Two possibilities remain. Either dark matter can be explained within an extension of the
      Standard Model, or it requires an entirely new theoretical framework. The answer will depend on
      whether future discoveries fit within existing physics or point toward a fundamentally new
      description of the universe.
