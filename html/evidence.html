            <p>Dark matter didn’t start as some dramatic sci-fi idea. It started as an accounting problem.</p>

            <p>
                In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky was studying the Coma Cluster, a huge collection of galaxies bound together by gravity. 
                His goal wasn’t revolutionary. He just wanted to measure how fast those galaxies were moving and 
                figure out how much mass was holding the cluster together.
            </p>

            <p>
                The logic is simple. If objects are moving quickly, gravity must be strong enough to keep them from flying off.
                 And stronger gravity means more mass.
            </p>

            <p>
               Zwicky measured the speeds. Then he calculated how much mass the cluster should have, based on all the stars and 
               glowing gas astronomers could see. It didn’t add up.
            </p>

         
            <p>
                The galaxies were moving so fast that, based on visible matter alone, the cluster should have ripped itself apart. But it hadn’t. It was stable. 
                That meant there had to be more mass there than anyone could see. Zwicky called it “dark matter.” Most people didn’t take it too seriously. 
                Partly because the idea sounded strange, and partly because Zwicky wasn’t exactly known for being gentle in debates. Still, the discrepancy lingered.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, decades later, the problem showed up again. This time, on a smaller scale, inside individual galaxies.
            </p>



            <p>
              In the 1970s, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford began measuring how stars move within spiral galaxies. Based on Newton’s laws, stars closer to the center should orbit faster, while those farther out should slow down. 
              It’s the same reason outer planets move more slowly around the Sun. Rubin and Ford expected to see that drop in speed.
            </p>

            <p>
              They didn’t.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, the outer stars were moving just as fast as the inner ones. The rotation curves were flat. And that’s not a minor detail. 
                If stars that far out are moving that quickly, there must be far more mass spread throughout the galaxy than what we can see.
            </p>

            <p> 
                In other words, galaxies seem to be wrapped in enormous halos of invisible matter. Not a thin layer. 
                Not a small correction. A dominant component.
            </p>

            <p>
                What made Rubin’s work especially powerful was repetition. 
                It wasn’t one odd galaxy. It was galaxy after galaxy showing the same behavior. Different instruments, different systems, same unsettling result.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                And since then, the case has only grown stronger. Light from distant objects bends more than visible matter alone can explain. The structure of the universe on large scales 
                matches models that include dark matter. Even the faint afterglow of the Big Bang carries the imprint of unseen mass.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dark matter isn’t a placeholder for imagination. It’s a response to stubborn evidence. Time and again, gravity behaves as if most of the universe is hidden.
            </p>

            <p>
                Zwicky saw galaxies in clusters moving too fast. Rubin and Ford saw stars in galaxies doing the same. Different eras. Same tension between observation and expectation.
            </p>

            <p>
                At some point, you stop blaming the calculator.
            </p>

            <p>
                Something is out there. It doesn’t shine. It doesn’t interact much. But its gravity shapes everything we see.
            </p>

            <p>
                And that quiet influence might be the loudest clue of all.
